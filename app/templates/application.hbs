    <p>Brydge is in Closed BETA.</p>

    <p>During this time, we will not be releasing a mobile-optimized experience.</p>

    <p>We know. It can be a little frustrating.</p>

    <p>But building something like this is complicated. We made a conscious decision to build it on the web first and test it with our early adopters â€“ before we go big on mobile.</p>

    <p>Below are some screenshots of Brydge on the web, and what you can expect. Trust us, it'll be worth it. A lot of thought has gone into building a truly useful professional networking tool. So check back in from a latptop or desktop. In the meantime, we'll get cracking on our shiny new mobile product.    </p>
