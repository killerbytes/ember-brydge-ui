    <p>Brydge is in Closed BETA. </p>

    <p>During this time, we will not be releasing a mobile-optimized experience.</p>

    <p>We know. It can be a little frustrating. </p>

    <p>But building something like this is complicated. We made a conscious decision to build it on the web first and test it with our early adopters â€“ before we go big on mobile. </p>

    <p>Below are some screenshots of Brydge on the web, and what you can expect. So check back in from a laptop or desktop. </p>

    <p>Trust us, it'll be worth it. </p>
